## Built With

* [React](https://reactjs.org/) - Frontend JavaScript library for building UI components.
* [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - Utility-first CSS framework for styling.
* [DaisyUI](https://daisyui.com/) - Tailwind CSS component library for enhanced UI components.

## Description

This lab project is a simple portfolio website built using React and styled with Tailwind CSS and DaisyUI. The portfolio includes sections for contact information, a summary, work experience, education, and top skills. It demonstrates the use of modern frontend technologies and deployment on Netlify.

## Sources Used

* My own LinkedIn profile for job details and summary.
* DaisyUI and Tailwind CSS documentation for implementing UI components and styling.
  
### Code Snippets

No external code was adapted. All code is original or from tutorials/documentation used for learning purposes.

## Artificial Intelligence Tools Used

* [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/) - Used to assist with project structure, component styling ideas, and hover effect solutions in Tailwind and DaisyUI.

**Prompt Example**:  
Generate hover effect for React component using Tailwind and DaisyUI to make background color darker on hover without making text unreadable.

**Response**:
```css
/* Example hover effect code suggested */
.transition {
  transition: all 0.3s ease-in-out;
}
.hover\:bg-gray-700:hover {
  background-color: #374151; /* Darker gray */
}
.hover\:text-gray-200:hover {
  color: #e5e7eb; /* Light gray */
}
```

This code was used in each section container for a subtle hover effect.

## Acknowledgments

* Thanks to the creators of DaisyUI and Tailwind CSS for providing excellent documentation and components.
